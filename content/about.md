Heya, I'm Haris. I've been working in and around software for about 15 years. This site is a place to dump all the stuff I have swimming in my head.

Things I talk about:

* Engineering Strategy
* Distributed Systems
* Teaching, mentorship, and paying it forward
* Screaming at the tides - random tirades against things I'm too dumb or old to understand

I'm currently employed as a Staff SRE at [Immuta](https://immuta.com). We've done a lot of cool stuff. Here are some blogs I wrote there:

* Terraform Engineering
  * [Make your modules thread-safe](https://medium.com/immuta-engineering/terraform-engineering-strategies-part-1-make-your-modules-thread-safe-1a7fdf1c2a2c)  
  * [Terraform isn't real](https://medium.com/immuta-engineering/terraform-isnt-real-cloud-provider-apis-ownership-and-lifecycle-blocks-a911dea1daba)
